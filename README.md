In this repository, countries are clustered by unsupervised learning. 
Data dimension is reduced by PCA method to three principal components. 
Explained Variance of components is studied, as well as components correlations. 
Two clustering algorithms is run on PCA data, KMeans and GMM. 
Cohesion vs. Separation in clusters are studied. 
All countries received their clustered labels utilizing each clustering algorithm, and their world map is visualized.
